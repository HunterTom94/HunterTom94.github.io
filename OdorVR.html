                    This project is an olfactory VR system to measure odor-guided behaviors in <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster" class="linkto"
                        target="blank">Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly)</a>. The system consists of three parts: a
                    spherical treadmill, an olfactometer (to deliver odor in a controlled manner), and a feedback system
                    (to update the delivery of odor based on the flyâ€™s position in the virtual world).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system is designed to be compatible with multi-photon imaging so that the neuron activity in
                    fly's brain can be recorded together with its behavioral activities.

                <h4>Spherical Treadmill</h4>
                <p>
                    The ball treadmill tracking system is initially invented by <a
                        href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00360648" class="linkto">Buchner in 1976</a>
                    and is now a relatively mature technique, where an animal is tethered and positioned on top of a
                    floating sphere pushed up by gentle air stream from the bottom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the animal walks, the sphere is turned and the animal is interpreted to be walking on a fictive
                    two-dimensional plane. The walking trajectory of the animal is inferred from the rotation of the
                    sphere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Video recording is used to determine the rotation of the sphere and the movement of the tethered
                    fly. Since 1976, methods have evolved over time , in this project I used <a
                        href="https://github.com/rjdmoore/fictrac" class="linkto">FicTrac</a> , an open-source
                    software that infers animals walking trajectory from video information of only one camera.

                    Odors are diluted before delivered to the animal. Two mass flow controllers (MFC) are used to
                    control odor concentration. One controller sets the flow rate of the air stream carrying the odor,
                    while the other sets the flow rate of the air stream that serves to dilute the odor. The two streams
                    are combined at a mixing chamber before delivered to the animal. The schematic diagram is shown
                    below:

                Code is written in Python to communicate with MFC through serial ports and is integrated with
                closed-loop control, which will be discussed in the following section. The code takes the final total
                flow rate and the target dilution factor as input, and find the best match of the combination of
                dilution MFC flow rate and odor MFC flow rate. Such flow rates are subsequently sent as commands to both
                MFCs as updated setpoints.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alicat MC Series MFCs are used because of their accuracy, fast response time and ability to be
                controlled via serial communication. After tuning PD parameters, the two controllers are able to reach a
                response time less than 100 milliseconds when the input is compressed air at 30 psi.
            </p>
            <p>
                The odor air stream and the dilution air stream are mixed at an odor mixing chamber that supports up to
                8 odor inputs. One metal grid is positioned at the output of the mixing chamber to increase the
                turbulence for better mixing. The diameter of the output port is 13.7mm. When the final output flow rate
                is set to be 500 Standard Cubic CentiMeters(SCCM), the speed of air stream coming out of the port would be 5.6 cm/s.
            </p>
            <p>
                Photoionization detector (PID) has been used to determine the performance of the olfactometer. The odor
                can be delivered well in pulse, but the concentration may fluctuate a lot if the odor is delivered
                continuously. This is potentially due to the depletion of odor inside the odor bottle.
            </p>
