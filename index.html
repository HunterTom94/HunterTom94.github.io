            <p>
                My name is Yinan (Tom) Xuan. I am currently a third year PhD student in the <a
                    href="https://biology.ucsd.edu/" class="linkto" target="blank">Division Of Biological Sciences</a>
                at University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I received my undergraduate training at UCSD in major of
                Physiology and Neuroscience with a minor of Cognitive Science. During my Ph.D. training, I worked with
                Professor <a
                    href="https://biology.ucsd.edu/research/faculty/jw800#research-tab" class="linkto" target="blank">Jing
                Wang</a> to study the neurobiology of olfaction in Drosophila Melanogaster, also known as the fruit
                flies.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the Wang Lab, I have developed and integrated an image processing software to extract individual cell
                activity information from videos of flattened fruit fly guts. I have also devised and implemented an
                olfactory virtual reality system to measure odor guided behaviors
                in fruit flies. I also had the opportunity to participate in building a custom three-photon fluorescent
                imaging rig.
                In this process, I learned free-space optics while aligning ultrafast laser for multiphoton (two & three
                photon) microscopy.
                I also helped build a custom (2nd order) auto-correlator to characterize the pulse-width of ultrafast
                emission from an Optical Parametric Amplifier.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the process of designing and implementing tools and algorithms to record and assess biological
                phenomena, I realized that my true passion really lies in building novel devices that can be used by
                humans to record activities and physiological states, thereby impacting their health and everyday lives
                positively. Therefore, I plan to graduate with a M.S. degree in June, 2020 and I am currently applying
                to other
                Ph.D. programs that allows me to do research in the field of ubiquitous computing.
                My research interests lie at the intersection of ubiquitous computing, personal tracking and health
                informatics. I am interested in designing and implementing novel systems and related algorithms to
                collect users’
                activity and physiological information in a naturalistic way, and leverage this information as inputs to
                computing systems.
            </p>
